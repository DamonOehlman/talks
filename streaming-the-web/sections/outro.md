  The `rtc-mesh` module is an [`rtc-quickconnect`](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-quickconnect) plugin that makes use of [scuttlebutt](https://github.com/dominictarr/scuttlebutt) to synchronize data across browsers using [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/) data channels.  Scuttlebutt's streaming interface makes this extremely simple.
