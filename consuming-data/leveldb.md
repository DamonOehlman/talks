## What is LevelDB?

> LevelDB is an open source on-disk key-value store written by Google Fellows Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat, who built parts of Google's platform. Inspired by BigTable, LevelDB is hosted on Google Code under the New BSD License and has been ported to a variety of Unix-based systems, Mac OS X, Windows, and Android. Open webOS's DB8 database service and also Basho Technologies' Riak use it as a backend.
