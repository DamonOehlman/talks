# Reusable JS

--

## Defining the Problem

- The widely adopted (and generally advertised) approaches to developing apps with JS are poor.
- When it comes to building the components of an app that require JS, many people abandon practices they would try and apply in a different language.

--

## Why is it so?

- Too much bad information
- Poor tooling support
- Not enough good information for good (well, better) approaches
- Just considered too hard
